### Q4
A first order reaction can described by the rate equation:
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle rate=k[X] ">

Derive an expression for the half life of [X] in terms of k and show it is time-independent.
[The half life of reactant, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle t_{\frac{1}{2}}"> is defined as the time taken for it to drop to half its initial concentration] 
 
### Q5
If a reaction is believed to be 1st order with respect to [X], what graph should be plotted to show confirm this?  How could the rate constant be determined? 

[Hint: a relationship which produces a straight line is the easiest to verify.]


### Q6 
Sketch plots of rate against [X] and rate against time. Explain the form of your plots. 

### Q7 
A second order reaction can described by the rate equation:
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle rate=k[X]^2 ">

Derive an expression for the half life of X in terms of k and confirm that it is time-dependent.
 
### Q8
What graph should be plotted to confirm a reaction is 2nd order with respect to X? How could the rate coefficient be determined? 

### Q9
Sketch a plot of rate against X. Explain the form of your plot. 

### Q10
Consider a general reaction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle X %2B\ X \rightarrow Z">

Derive an expressions for [Z] as a function of time the inital concentration of X.
 
### Q11
A reaction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle X \rightarrow Z"> has a rate which can be written as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle rate = k[X]"> with rate constant <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle k = 3.2 \times 10^{-3} s^{-1}">

How long will it take for:
i. [X] to reach <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{1}{16}"> of its original value?

ii. [X] to reach <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{1}{e}"> of its original value (this is called the lifetime, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\tau">, of the reactant)?

iii. [Z] to reach <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{3}{4}"> of its final value?

### Q16
For an exothermic, single step reaction the enthalpy change of a reaction is denoted <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta H"> and the activation energy of the forward reaction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E_{a1}">. Express the activation energy of the reverse reaction, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E_{a-1}">, in terms of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta H"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E_{a1}">.
 
### Q17

### Q18
Write down a differential equation describing the rate of change of [O] for the 4 reactions in the Chapman cycle. 
 
### Q19
Consider a reaction scheme:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C"> 

with rate constants k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> for the first and second reactions. 

It so happens that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k_2 \gg k_1"> (i.e. B is in steady state) and [A]=[A]<sub>0</sub> when t=0.

Derive expressions for [A],[B] & [C] in terms of [A]<sub>0</sub>, t, k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub>. 
 
### Q20
Now consider the situation in the previous question with the additional reactions: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B \rightarrow A"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C \rightarrow B">

These have rate constants k<sub>-1</sub> and k<sub>-2</sub> respectively. 

Write expressions for the rates of change of [A],[B] & [C]. In the special case where [B] is in steady state, derive an expression for its concentration.
