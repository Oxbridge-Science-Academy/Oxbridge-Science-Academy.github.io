We apply three machine learning strategies to atomic cooling processes utilized in the production of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and, for the first time, optimize both laser cooling and evaporative cooling mechanisms simultaneously. We present the results of an evolutionary optimization method (Differential Evolution), a regression method based on non-parametric inference (Gaussian Process regression) and a gradient-based function approximator (Artificial Neural Network). Online optimization is performed using no prior knowledge of the relevant experimental settings. Optimizing these cooling processes results in a factor of four increase in BEC size, as compared to intensive manual optimization and provides an automated approach that maintains close to optimal performance in long-term operation. Furthermore, we show that machine learning techniques can be used to identify the main sources of instability within the apparatus.
