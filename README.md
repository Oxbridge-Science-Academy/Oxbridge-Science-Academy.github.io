# Differential Equations

 A key progression from high school to university is thinking about rates with a more quantitative mindset. This is done by linking the two different rate equations â€“ the differential equation and the power law equation. 

Consider the simple reaction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle X \rightarrow Y">

We can express the rate of reaction as:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle rate=k[X]">

or 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle rate=-\frac{d[X]}{dt}">
