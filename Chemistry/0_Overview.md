## Key Objectives
To consider the high school topic of chemical kinetics in a more quantitative way. The key point to understand is the link between power law and differential rate equation forms and how they can be combined to form a mathematical expression for a concentration profile.
 
To understand the some of the ways we can measure rates of reaction and determine the order of a reaction. 
 
To understand the use of energy profiles and extend this (qualitatively) to the concepts of energy landscapes.
