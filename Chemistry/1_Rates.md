# Rate of Reaction

Consider the reaction:

involving the molecules A, B, C & D with stoichiometric coefficients α, β, γ & δ respectively. How do we define the rate of reaction? 
 
There are several options:
- Average time for A or B to react from mixing
- Time taken from A and B making contact to C and D being formed? (~10<sup>-14</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>)
- Rate of change of particular species’ concentration

### Definition
Rate of reaction is defined in terms of the rate of change of a particular species’ concentration

For example, we can define the rate in terms of the rate of change of the concentration of reactant A or product C:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle rate = -\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{d[A]}{dt} = \frac{1}{\gamma} \frac{d[C]}{dt} ">


Note how the derivative is divided by the species’ stoichiometric coefficient and a minus sign is introduced if the species is a reactant since its concentration will decrease while the rate is always positive by convention. 

### Units
Thus the reaction rate has units of concentration per unit time. The most common units are as mol dm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for reactions happening in a liquid or aqueous phase and molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for reactions occuring in the gas phase.
